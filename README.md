###Exploring Vancouver's Street Trees

Overview

This project explores the street trees of Vancouver using the dataset from Vancouver Open Data. The dataset includes details about the trees on boulevards such as species, location, and more. Private and park trees are not part of this dataset.

We aim to explore the most common trees across Vancouverâ€™s neighborhoods, analyze trends, and visualize data insights such as species distribution and the relationship between tree characteristics.
